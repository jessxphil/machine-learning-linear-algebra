<p align="center"> This repository is for learning purposes only. Please follow the Coursera honor code. Best of luck! :) 

I've posted the answers here with the intent that it helps with debugging your own code. I encourage you not to copy from these resources, but instead to understand why your program isn't working as expected. The discussion forums available via Coursera are pretty useful, and I recommend asking for help there before using the resources posted here. </p>

Introduction to Linear Algebra: In this first module we look at how linear algebra is relevant to machine learning and data science. Then we'll wind up the module with an initial introduction to vectors. Throughout, we're focussing on developing your mathematical intuition, not of crunching through algebra or doing long pen-and-paper examples. For many of these operations, there are callable functions in Python that can do the adding up - the point is to appreciate what they do and how they work so that, when things go wrong or there are special cases, you can understand why and what to do.
