Here's a peak into what you'll learn in the course! Apply a matrix transformation to the coordinates of each of the pixels in an image to transform the image as a whole. Given a starting image (such as this one of “The Ambassadors” [1533] by Hans Holbein the Younger), which is made up of 400×400 pixels, if we apply the same transformation to each of those 160,000 pixels, what will the the transformed image become? 

## Mini Lecture Notes
<b>Week 1:</b> Introduction to Linear Algebra: In this first module we looked at how linear algebra is relevant to machine learning and data science. Then we ended the module with an initial introduction to vectors.  

<b>Week 2:</b> Calculated the basic operations (dot product, modulus, negation) on vectors. And examined how the entries describing a vector will depend on what vectors we use to define the axes - the basis.

<b>Week 3:</b> In the next week, I learned how to understand what a matrix is and how it corresponds to a transformation. Afterwards I explain and calculated inverse and determinant of matrices. 

<b>Week 4:</b> Identify matrices as operators. Relate the transformation matrix to a set of new basis vectors. 

<b>Week 5:</b> Identify geometrically what an eigenvector/value is. Apply mathematical formulation in simple cases. Build an intuition of larger dimention eigensystems
