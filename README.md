caption: A peak into what you'll learn in the course? Apply a matrix transformation to the coordinates of each of the pixels in an image to transform the image as a whole. Given a starting image (such as this one of “The Ambassadors” [1533] by Hans Holbein the Younger), which is made up of 400×400 pixels, if we apply the same transformation to each of those 160,000 pixels, what will the the transformed image becomes

## Mini Lecture Notes
Week 1: Introduction to Linear Algebra: In this first module we look at how linear algebra is relevant to machine learning and data science. Then we'll wind up the module with an initial introduction to vectors.
